      "This build specializes in vaulting speed and generator control. By kicking generators, you can reveal survivors locations and drastically reduce chase time — by up to 80%. The pros? You’ll find survivors fast and end chases even faster, simply by tracking which gens are being worked on. However, there are a few cons. Without Corrupt Intervention, survivors can start doing gens immediately. There’s also not much slowdown built into the kit, and your ability to kick generators is limited. Overall, this build works well with nearly every killer in the game — especially M1-based killers. Fire Up becomes more powerful as the trial progresses, making you increasingly lethal in the late game.",
