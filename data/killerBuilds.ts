      "This build specializes in vaulting speed and generator control. By kicking generators, you can reveal survivors locations and drastically reduce chase time — by up to 80%. The pros? You’ll find survivors fast and end chases even faster, simply by tracking which gens are being worked on. However, there are a few cons. Without Corrupt Intervention, survivors can start doing gens immediately. There’s also not much slowdown built into the kit, and your ability to kick generators is limited. Overall, this build works well with nearly every killer in the game — especially M1-based killers. Fire Up becomes more powerful as the trial progresses, making you increasingly lethal in the late game.",

    description: `Designed for aggressive M1 chases, this build focuses on maintaining relentless pressure by vaulting quickly and efficiently. With "Bamboozle" to slow down survivors’ escape routes, "Enduring" to reduce stun durations, and "Spirit Fury" to punish generators when stunned, you keep the chase momentum alive. "Fire Up" enhances your lethality as generators fall, making you deadlier the longer the trial goes on. Ideal for killers who want to control the map with speed, precision, and tactical aggression.`,

    description: `This build transforms the Wraith into a relentless hunter, silently commanding the map with precision. "Whispers" alerts you to the faintest presence of survivors nearby, while "Territorial Imperative" sharpens your awareness around hooks and generators. "Pop Goes the Weasel" strikes back at survivors by regressing generators after each hook, and "Hex: Ruin" slows their progress, making every second count. Perfect for killers who prefer strategic patience and punishing map control over flashy stealth mechanics.`,

    description: `An oppressive build that forces survivors to play on edge. "Hex: Ruin" cripples generator repair speeds, "Agitation" increases your movement speed while carrying survivors, and "Hex: Devour Hope" builds lethal tokens for each hooked survivor. "Corrupt Intervention" blocks distant generators early on, funneling survivors into your traps. This build embodies control and intimidation, making it harder for survivors to breathe and easier for you to dictate the trial's rhythm.`,

    perks: ["Enduring", "Spirit Fury", "Lightborn", "Barbecue & Chili"],
    description: `This build combines brutal chase potential with high map pressure. "Enduring" lessens the impact of pallet stuns, "Spirit Fury" punishes survivors who stun you, and "Lightborn" protects you from blindness effects. "Barbecue & Chili" grants global aura reading after hooking survivors, fueling your hunt. For killers who thrive on punishing mistakes and maintaining relentless aggression, this build turns every chase into a deadly sprint.`,
