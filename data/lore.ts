    title: "The Entity’s Hunger",
    description:
      "The Entity is an eldritch horror that feeds on emotion—fear, hope, despair—from both Survivors and Killers. It sustains an endless cycle of Trials, trapping its victims in realms stitched from memories to sate its cosmic appetite.",

    title: "The Fog’s True Nature",
    description:
      "The ever-present Fog—also called Auric Fog—is alive, woven from the memories and atoms of the Entity’s victims. It shapes reality within the realms and is more than backdrop—it is creation.",

    title: "Hooks as Rituals",
    description:
      "Meat hooks are shrines, not mere torture devices. When a Survivor is sacrificed, the Entity’s extensions raise them skyward—turning their pain into ritual and energy.",

    title: "The Void Realm: Discarded Souls",
    description:
      "Once a Survivor is drained of hope and emotion, they are discarded into the Void—a barren sub‑realm filled with hollow shells. The Entity casts them away once they no longer serve its hunger.",

    title: "Memory Erased Between Trials",
    description:
      "After escape or death, Survivors are returned to the campfire—but their memories of the Trial are wiped clean. The cycle resets: hope kindled, suffering reignited, and the Entity fed anew.",

    title: "Killers: Chosen Instruments",
    description: `
    Killers are not born in these realms—they are summoned, selected, or seduced. The Entity watches from the void, seeking out those twisted by cruelty, broken by trauma, or lost to obsession. Some come willingly, seeking purpose or power. Others are dragged into the fog, their screams swallowed by the dark.

    The Entity does not merely take—it transforms. It distorts their memories, reshapes their flesh, and binds them to an eternal hunt. These Killers become instruments of fear, forced to stalk and slaughter in endless trials. Their humanity fades, replaced by a cold hunger that echoes the will of their master.

    Each act of terror feeds the Entity. Each chase, each scream, each sacrifice is part of a greater ritual—one that never ends. The Killers hunt not for revenge, nor redemption, but because they must. They are the fog’s favored children, and in this place, mercy is a forgotten word.

    title: "Survivor: Hope as Fuel",
    description: `
    The Entity does not thrive on fear alone—it feasts upon hope, that fragile ember clutched by those who resist. Within its realms, every Generator sparked, every item found, every glimpse of an exit is by design. These are not gifts, but cruel illusions—bait hung in the mist to stir desperate belief.

    Survivors cling to that hope, fight for it, bleed for it. And just when escape seems within reach, the Entity strikes. It drinks deeply from the anguish of broken dreams, from the terror that follows trust. In this eternal trial, hope is not salvation. It is the sweetest fuel of all.

    title: "Sub‑Realms and The Observer",
    description: `
    Beneath the Entity’s vast hunting grounds lies a fractured labyrinth of sub-realms—shards of forgotten places, fractured memories, and discarded horrors stitched together in silence. These hidden pockets, while overlooked by most, hum with strange energy and lost truths.

    Within one such realm dwells The Observer, a mysterious figure and one of the last known survivors of Terra Primus. Neither Killer nor active Survivor, he remains cloaked in shadow, watching, recording, and dissecting the nature of the Entity. Though isolated, he carries a singular purpose: to unravel the Entity’s essence, and perhaps, one day, find a way to weaken, starve, or destroy it.

    His writings hint at a deeper architecture behind the trials—a grander design fueled by suffering, memory, and an ancient hunger that predates human thought. The fog may be thick, but in the Observer’s haven, there is still a flicker of resistance.

    title: "The Void Realm in Events",
    description: `
    During Haunted by Daylight events, players are lured into the Void—a surreal, liminal realm where reality unravels and forgotten souls drift. This spectral domain exists parallel to the Entity’s trials, its walls humming with ancient energy and spectral unrest.

    Within the Void, survivors and killers collect Void Energy, a volatile essence drawn from interactions and conflict. Haunts—remnants of those consumed—roam this space, bound by echoes of suffering. When enough energy is gathered, it can be offered to Unstable Rifts—shimmering tears in the veil that briefly open portals into the Void.

    Stepping into this realm is more than a mechanic—it’s a descent into the unknown, a rare moment where players glimpse the Entity’s deeper influence. In the Void, even the fog trembles.

    title: "Ancient Cosmic Evil",
    description: `
    The Entity is not merely old—it is *primordial*, a being born beyond the veil of time, from a realm before reality took shape. Known to some as an 'Original One', it drifts between worlds, sensing when darkness takes root and violence festers in the hearts of living beings.

    Drawn to suffering like a predator to blood, it invades these corrupted worlds through rifts in reality, twisting them into nightmarish reflections of themselves. It feeds on agony, despair, and the slow unraveling of hope—growing stronger with every soul it ensnares, tortures, or sacrifices.

    Immortal, unknowable, and ever-hungry, the Entity cannot be reasoned with or destroyed by conventional means. It is not death, but something colder. Something older. A shadow cast across all of existence, waiting for fear to bloom—so it may feast again.
