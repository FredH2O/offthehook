    title: "The Entity’s Hunger",
    description:
      "The Entity is an eldritch horror that feeds on emotion—fear, hope, despair—from both Survivors and Killers. It sustains an endless cycle of Trials, trapping its victims in realms stitched from memories to sate its cosmic appetite.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Fog’s True Nature",
    description:
      "The ever-present Fog—also called Auric Fog—is alive, woven from the memories and atoms of the Entity’s victims. It shapes reality within the realms and is more than backdrop—it is creation.",
  },
  {
    title: "Hooks as Rituals",
    description:
      "Meat hooks are shrines, not mere torture devices. When a Survivor is sacrificed, the Entity’s extensions raise them skyward—turning their pain into ritual and energy.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Void Realm: Discarded Souls",
    description:
      "Once a Survivor is drained of hope and emotion, they are discarded into the Void—a barren sub‑realm filled with hollow shells. The Entity casts them away once they no longer serve its hunger.",
  },
  {
    title: "Memory Erased Between Trials",
    description:
      "After escape or death, Survivors are returned to the campfire—but their memories of the Trial are wiped clean. The cycle resets: hope kindled, suffering reignited, and the Entity fed anew.",
  },

  {
    title: "Killers: Chosen Instruments",
    description:
      "Killers are drawn or summoned into the Entity’s realms—some coerced, others willingly offered. The Entity selects those with latent cruelty or trauma, corrupts them, and forces them to hunt, sustaining its needs.",
  },
  {
    title: "Survivor Hope as Fuel",
    description:
      "The Entity doesn’t just prey on fear—it also feeds on hope. By granting Generators, items, or escape opportunities, it tricks Survivors into hoping, then cruelly dashes it, extracting deep emotional currency.",
  },
  {
    title: "Sub‑Realms and The Observer",
    description:
      "Beneath the Entity’s main realms exist hundreds of sub‑realms. Notably, The Observer (a survivor of Terra Primus) hides within one, studying the Entity and seeking a way to destroy or starve it.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Void Realm in Events",
    description:
      "During Haunted by Daylight events, players enter the Void: a liminal space where Void Energy is collected and Haunts roam. Offering energy to Unstable Rifts opens portals—brief windows into the Void.",
  },
  {
    title: "Ancient Cosmic Evil",
    description:
      "The Entity is immortal—an ‘Original One’ from across worlds. It corrupts and consumes worlds rich in darkness and violence, growing stronger with every soul it tortures or sacrifices.",
  },
