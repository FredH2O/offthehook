            This build specialises in vaulting, kicking generators to see
            survivors, ending chase time by almost 80%, pros of this build is
            you can chase survivors fast, find them fast just by looking for
            generators being done. cons is that at the start of the trial
            survivors can do gens straight away without corrupt intervention,
            not much slow down, and can only kick generators a certain amount of
            time. overall this build is good for almost every killer in the game
            specially M1 killers.

            This build specialises in chase time, squeezing every little seconds
            you can from a killer so that your team mates can do generators.
            Lithe for running away after a vault, Resilience speeds up your
            vaulting and Finesse for that fast vault at the start. pros is if
            your good with loops and vaulting then this build can be lethal even
            when youre injured. cons is that if your injured finesse wont work
            and resilience doesnt work when youre healthy. but this build
            balances everything against almost every situation. Kindred is our
            main aura reading unless its a stealth killer.
